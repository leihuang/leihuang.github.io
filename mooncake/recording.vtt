00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.070
Phones,

2
00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:03.230
Mary. Go round at the beach.

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.579
We walk up to the cliff house,

4
00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.730
sea lions and tourists.

5
00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.170
The old washed out road that goes on

6
00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.619
play chess and mechanics.

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.720
Dress up and go looking for work

8
00:00:16.959 --> 00:00:20.100
to seek out the wood on trees in the park. Arbana

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.750
suck in the sea air and hold it.

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.879
Miles of white walls. Sunset shoots back from somebody's window high in the feed.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.500
Get drunk all the time.

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.139
Go someplace and score,

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.470
walk, walk in and walk out of the ass.

14
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.110
Hike up. Tamil pies.

15
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:47.209
Keep quitting and starting at Berkeley

16
00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:51.150
was the pike in the Steinhart Aquarium.

17
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.729
He doesn't move,

18
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:55.569
sleeping with a stranger

19
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.169
taking supers after sitting

20
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.680
practicing your frailing on the guitar.

21
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:03.930
You get dropped off in the fog at night.

22
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.209
Fall in love 20 times. Get divorced.

23
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.610
Keep moving.

24
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.250
Move out to the sunset.

25
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:13.540
It lost

26
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.879
or

27
00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:16.209
get found

28
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.160
also. Does anyone want to jump in?

29
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.760
Mhm.

30
00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.410
I mean,

31
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.970
I'm

32
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.349
not gonna

33
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.779
nothing water

34
00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.430
anybody.

35
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.620
Uh, the

36
00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.550

37
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.750
Oh.

38
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.809
Did you join us for the Senate?

39
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.139
I

40
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.589

41
00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:02.129
Ok.

42
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.809
I will never see

43
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.150
you

44
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.600
crazy.

45
00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.289
Yeah.

46
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.960
Mhm.

47
00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.479
Then

48
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.869
that one basically.

49
00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.330
Oh, are you contributing with the president?

50
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.250
Are you?

51
00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.669
What is your name, by the way?

52
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.259
Me too. Me

53
00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.759

54
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.020
What

55
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.589

59
00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.389
No

60
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.660
lights were

61
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.460

66
00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:51.699

Mhm.

Ok.
